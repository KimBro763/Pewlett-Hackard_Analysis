# **Pewlett Hackard**

## **Project Overview
### Purpose and Background
As Pewlett Hackard has thousands of baby boomers approaching retirement age, this project will help the company prepare for the ‘silver tsunami’. With the task of conducting employee research, data from six csv tables was used to build an employee database with sequel. The project subsequently identified upcoming retirees, the positions being vacated, and employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results 

* *Number of Upcoming Retirees*:

    There are a total of 90,398 upcoming total retirees, which is 30% of the total workforce at Pewlett Hackard. 


* *Positions Opening*:

    The majority of positions opening are for Senior Engineers (29,414) and Senior Staff (28,254). Please see Table 1 below for further information.

* *Lack of Mentors*

    There is a shortage of eligible mentors. At present, there are 691 qualified, retirement_ready mentors but 90,398 upcoming vacancies. 


## Summary 
A total of 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact. As of now, there are 691 qualified, retirement-ready mentors. This means for every four mentors there are 523 mentees that would need to be trained. However, if the birth date requirement extended to those born between 1965 and 1968, there would instead be 1 mentor to every 3.5 mentees. See Tables 3 and 4 below for more details.
